# NNLearn
This project aims to develop a learning prototype for various concepts involved in Neural Network and Deep Learning

# Usage
Project follows various components with various stages of development.
At present, following components exist:

 - Simple demonstration for `backpropagation algorithm`
 - A sample experiment to classify digits based on MNIST dataset: `digit_demo.py`

# Dependencies
 - Python 3+
 - numpy

# TODO
 - Converting to a functional library
 - Adding features such as Regularisation, Momentum, Dropout
